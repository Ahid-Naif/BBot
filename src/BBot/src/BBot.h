          B-Bot
  ========================
  The B-Bot aims to provide a useful complementary tool for STEM education through robotics.
  The invention resides broadly in a flexible and modular robot that can be built by children
  using the different parts that are provided with the kit. It is an adaptable platform that
  takes into consideration the age and learning capabilities of a child. The robot also comes
  with a wide range of sensors, actuators and a graphical programming softwares to program the robot.
  The B-Bot aims at providing an engaging complementary tool to the current methods of
  learning by providing students with a hands-on learning experience in the field of
  Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.
